# External Access Configuration

MorphBox can be configured to accept connections from external networks, not just localhost. This is useful for:
- Testing on different devices on your network
- Collaborating with team members
- Accessing MorphBox from a VM or container

## üö® EXTREME SECURITY WARNING - READ CAREFULLY üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: The `--external` flag exposes your ENTIRE development environment to ANYONE on your network!**

### What --external mode exposes:
- ‚ùå **FULL terminal access with root capabilities**
- ‚ùå **Complete file system access** - attackers can read, modify, or delete ANY file
- ‚ùå **Command execution** - attackers can run ANY command on your system
- ‚ùå **Environment variables** - including API keys, passwords, and secrets
- ‚ùå **Network pivot** - your machine can be used to attack other systems
- ‚ùå **Claude AI access** - attackers can use your AI assistant to write malicious code

### Real-world attack scenarios:
1. **Code theft**: Attackers can steal your entire codebase, including proprietary code
2. **Credential harvesting**: SSH keys, AWS credentials, API tokens can be stolen
3. **Backdoor installation**: Persistent malware can be installed on your system
4. **Ransomware**: Your files can be encrypted and held for ransom
5. **Cryptomining**: Your machine can be used to mine cryptocurrency
6. **Lateral movement**: Your machine becomes a launching point for network attacks

### Authentication is NOT enough:
While `--external` mode now requires authentication:
- üîê This only prevents casual/accidental access
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Does NOT protect against determined attackers**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Does NOT protect against vulnerabilities in the application**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Does NOT protect against brute force attacks**

### ONLY use --external when ALL of these are true:
‚úÖ You are on a completely isolated network (air-gapped)
‚úÖ The machine contains NO sensitive data
‚úÖ The machine has NO access to production systems
‚úÖ You understand and accept the risks
‚úÖ You have explicit permission from your security team
‚úÖ You have monitoring and alerting in place

### NEVER use --external:
‚ùå On public WiFi
‚ùå On corporate networks
‚ùå On machines with production access
‚ùå On machines with customer data
‚ùå On machines with source code for commercial products
‚ùå When working with sensitive or regulated data

**If you're unsure whether to use --external, the answer is NO.**

## Usage

### Command Line Options

```bash
# Default - local only (safe)
./morphbox-start

# Expose to network (requires confirmation)
./morphbox-start --external

# Explicitly set to local only
./morphbox-start --local
```

### Configuration File

For persistent configuration, create a `.morphbox.env` file:

```bash
cp .morphbox.env.example .morphbox.env
```

Edit `.morphbox.env`:
```env
# Set to "external" to always bind to all interfaces
MORPHBOX_BIND_MODE=external

# Or leave as "local" for localhost only (default)
MORPHBOX_BIND_MODE=local
```

## Network Details

When running with `--external`:
- Web interface binds to `0.0.0.0:8008` (all interfaces)
- WebSocket server binds to `0.0.0.0:8009` (all interfaces)
- The launcher will display your local IP address for easy access

## Firewall Configuration

You may need to allow ports 8008 and 8009 through your firewall:

### Linux (ufw)
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8008/tcp
sudo ufw allow 8009/tcp
```

### macOS
The firewall will prompt you to allow connections when you first run with `--external`.

### Windows
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "MorphBox Web" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 8008 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "MorphBox WebSocket" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 8009 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

## Safer Alternatives to --external

### 1. Use VPN Mode (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
./morphbox-start --vpn
```
- Only accessible via VPN connection
- Much more secure than --external
- Optional authentication with `--vpn --auth`

### 2. SSH Tunneling
```bash
# On remote machine
ssh -L 8008:localhost:8008 -L 8009:localhost:8009 user@morphbox-host

# Then access via localhost on remote machine
open http://localhost:8008
```

### 3. Reverse Proxy with Authentication
Use nginx/Apache with proper authentication and HTTPS.

### 4. Docker with Limited Networking
Run MorphBox in a container with restricted network access.

## If You MUST Use --external

### Minimum Security Requirements:
1. **Generate strong credentials** - Use the auto-generated passwords
2. **Firewall rules** - Restrict to specific IP addresses
3. **Network isolation** - Use a separate VLAN
4. **Monitoring** - Log all access attempts
5. **Time limits** - Only enable when actively needed
6. **Regular updates** - Keep MorphBox and dependencies updated

### Additional Hardening:
```bash
# Restrict to specific IPs with iptables
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8008 -s TRUSTED_IP -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8008 -j DROP

# Use fail2ban to block brute force attempts
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
```

### Monitoring Commands:
```bash
# Watch for connections
watch -n 1 'netstat -an | grep -E "8008|8009"'

# Monitor auth attempts (after implementing logging)
tail -f ~/morphbox/logs/auth.log

# Check for suspicious processes
ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -E "node|npm"
```

## Emergency Response

If you suspect compromise while using --external:
1. **Immediately stop MorphBox**: `pkill -f morphbox`
2. **Block the ports**: `sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8008 -j DROP`
3. **Check for persistence**: Review crontab, systemd services
4. **Audit commands**: Review `history`, check for new users
5. **Check file modifications**: `find ~ -mtime -1 -type f`
6. **Consider the machine compromised**: Reinstall if sensitive data was accessible

## Troubleshooting

If external access isn't working:
1. Check firewall settings
2. Verify the displayed IP address is correct
3. Ensure no other services are using ports 8008/8009
4. Check that your network allows local device communication
