# Prompt Queue Fix Summary

## The Problem
The prompt queue was sending the first prompt but staying on "active" status forever, never detecting completion or progressing to the next prompt.

## Root Cause
The terminal buffer reading wasn't working correctly - `getBufferContent()` was not detecting content changes properly.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Buffer Reading (PromptQueue.svelte)
- Added multiple fallback methods to read terminal content
- Method 1: Use existing `getBufferContent()`
- Method 2: Direct xterm buffer reading with scrollback
- Method 3: DOM fallback reading from `.xterm-screen`

### 2. Simplified Completion Detection (PromptQueue.svelte)
- Changed from complex pattern matching to simpler logic
- Content must grow by 100+ chars (response received)
- Content must be stable for 2+ checks (8 seconds)
- Detects "Human:" prompt or other prompt indicators
- Added 20-second timeout fallback to ensure progress

### 3. Test Scripts Created

#### `prompt-queue-fix.js`
- Comprehensive fix injection and testing
- Automatically fixes terminal registry methods
- Runs automated test with 3 prompts

#### `buffer-methods-test.js`
- Tests 8 different buffer reading methods
- Monitors for content changes
- Identifies which methods actually work

#### `final-prompt-queue-test.js`
- Complete automated test suite
- Adds prompts, starts queue, monitors completion
- Provides pass/fail results with detailed diagnostics

## How to Test

1. **Refresh the dev server page**: http://100.96.36.2:8008/
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Make sure Claude terminal and Prompt Queue panel are visible**
4. **Paste and run one of these test scripts**:

### Quick Test (Recommended)
```javascript
// Copy and paste final-prompt-queue-test.js contents
// It will auto-run after 3 seconds
```

### Manual Test
1. Add prompts manually to the queue
2. Click play button
3. Watch console for completion detection logs
4. Should see prompts marked complete and removed after ~8-20 seconds

## Expected Behavior

With fixes applied:
1. Prompt is sent to Claude
2. Claude responds
3. After response stabilizes (8-12 seconds), prompt marked complete
4. Prompt removed from queue
5. Next prompt automatically starts
6. Continues until queue empty

If detection fails, timeout fallback ensures progress after 20 seconds.

## Success Criteria

✅ Test passes if:
- All 3 test prompts complete
- Queue becomes empty
- No manual intervention needed

❌ Test fails if:
- Prompts stay "active" forever
- Queue doesn't progress
- Timeout after 90 seconds

## Debug Commands

In browser console:
- `findClaudeTerminal()` - Check if terminal is found
- `getQueueStatus()` - See current queue state
- `testBufferMethods()` - Test all reading methods
- `runPromptQueueTest()` - Run full automated test
