# Terminal Width Issue Analysis

## Problem Summary
Based on the browser logs, the terminal is only getting 410px width out of a 1512px viewport (27% of available width). This explains the "half width on desktop" issue.

## Key Findings from Logs:

1. **Container Dimensions**: 410x370 pixels
2. **Viewport**: 1512x857 pixels
3. **Terminal sizing**: Correctly sized to 47 cols x 19 rows for the 410px container
4. **Issue**: The panel container itself is too narrow, not the terminal sizing logic

## Root Cause:
The terminal is correctly filling its container, but the container (panel) is only getting ~27% of the viewport width. This suggests:
- Multiple panels in the same row sharing the width
- Or a layout constraint limiting the panel width
- Or CSS flex/grid issues at the row/layout level

## What's Working:
- Terminal measurement function is working correctly
- Terminal is properly sizing to fill its container
- Character dimension calculations are accurate

## What's Not Working:
- The panel/row layout is constraining the terminal panel to only 410px width
- This is a layout issue, not a terminal sizing issue

## Next Steps:
1. Check how many panels are in the row with the terminal
2. Verify the row's width distribution among panels
3. Check if there are CSS constraints at the layout level
4. Ensure the terminal panel gets appropriate flex-grow or width percentage
