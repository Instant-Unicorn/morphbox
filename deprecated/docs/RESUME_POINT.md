# MorphBox Branch Merge Resume Point
**Date:** 2025-08-03
**Branch:** comments (merged with morph-file-format and npm-packaging)

## ‚úÖ What We Accomplished

### Successfully Merged 3 Branches:
1. **comments branch** - NPM packaging improvements, terminal fixes
2. **morph-file-format branch** - .morph file format for portable custom panels
3. **npm-packaging branch** - Clean package structure without test files

### Fixed Critical Issues:
- ‚úÖ Resolved all merge conflicts 
- ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript error in websocket.ts line 247
- ‚úÖ Fixed workspace sandboxing issue (terminal had full server access)
- ‚úÖ Created `claude-restricted` wrapper in docker-entrypoint.sh
- ‚úÖ Updated websocket-proxy.js to use claude-restricted command
- ‚úÖ Updated prepare-package.sh to remove existing binaries before install

## üîß Last Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Workspace Sandboxing Issue
**Problem:** Terminal had access to entire server, workspace directory was empty
**Root Cause:** `websocket-proxy.js` was calling non-existent `claude-restricted` command
**Solution:** 
- Added `claude-restricted` wrapper creation to `/docker-entrypoint.sh`
- Updated `websocket-proxy.js` to use `claude-restricted`
- Wrapper ensures Claude starts in /workspace with proper restrictions

### 2. Files Modified:
- `/home/kruger/projects/morphbox/docker-entrypoint.sh` - Added claude-restricted wrapper
- `/home/kruger/projects/morphbox/web/websocket-proxy.js` - Uses claude-restricted
- `/home/kruger/projects/morphbox/web/prepare-package.sh` - Removes existing binaries
- `/home/kruger/projects/morphbox/web/src/lib/server/websocket.ts` - Fixed type error

## üìã Next Steps to Complete

1. **Rebuild Docker Container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Test the Package:**
   ```bash
   cd web
   ./prepare-package.sh
   morphbox
   ```

3. **Verify Functionality:**
   - [ ] Terminal starts in /workspace with project visible
   - [ ] Claude auto-launches with workspace restrictions
   - [ ] Custom panel creation works
   - [ ] .morph file import/export works
   - [ ] All panels load correctly

4. **If Everything Works:**
   - [ ] Commit all changes
   - [ ] Push to origin/comments
   - [ ] Consider merging to main

2. **.morph Files** - Portable custom panels with full export/import
3. **Terminal Fixes** - Proper workspace restrictions and Claude integration
4. **WebSocket Proxy** - For packaged mode terminal support

### Current Branch Status:
```
Branch: comments
Ahead of origin/comments by 50 commits
Has all features from: morph-file-format, npm-packaging, comments
```

## üîç Testing Checklist

Before considering this branch ready:
- [ ] Docker container rebuilt with new entrypoint
- [ ] Terminal properly restricted to /workspace
- [ ] Claude launches automatically and stays in workspace
- [ ] Custom panels can be created via UI
- [ ] .morph files can be exported and imported
- [ ] Package installs globally without errors
- [ ] `morphbox` command works from any directory

## üí° Known Issues/Warnings

1. **CSS Warnings** during build - Not critical, just unused selectors
2. **A11y Warnings** - Minor accessibility issues in DragHandle/PanelContainer
3. **Auto-generated files** modified - Normal for SvelteKit

## üéØ Summary

The branch is functionally complete with all three feature sets merged. The main remaining task is to rebuild the Docker container and test that the workspace sandboxing works correctly. Once verified, this branch can replace main with significant improvements:
- Better packaging system
- Portable custom panels (.morph files)
- Fixed terminal/workspace restrictions
- WebSocket proxy for packaged deployments
