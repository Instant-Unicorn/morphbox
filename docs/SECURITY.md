# Security Policy

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY INFORMATION üö®

MorphBox is a powerful development environment that provides terminal access, file system access, and code execution capabilities. This document outlines critical security considerations.

## üîí Security Model (v0.9.4+)

The following security improvements have been implemented:

### Network Isolation Security (v0.9.4+)
- ‚úÖ **Passwordless authentication**: Container uses empty passwords within isolated network
- ‚úÖ **Network-based security**: Security enforced through localhost/VPN isolation
- ‚úÖ **Origin validation**: WebSocket connections validate origin headers
- ‚úÖ **Optional web auth**: Authentication available with --auth flag for VPN/external modes

### Container Security
- ‚úÖ **Isolated environment**: Container accessible only via localhost or VPN
- ‚úÖ **Passwordless sudo**: NOPASSWD sudo for convenience in isolated container
- ‚úÖ **SSH configuration**: PermitEmptyPasswords enabled for simplified access

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ‚úÖ **Command sanitization**: Input validation and dangerous pattern detection
- ‚úÖ **Size limits**: Maximum input length to prevent DoS attacks
- ‚úÖ **Path validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks

### Error Handling & Logging
- ‚úÖ **Secure error messages**: Generic errors in production, no stack traces
- ‚úÖ **Audit logging**: Security events logged with unique IDs
- ‚úÖ **Security monitoring**: Webhook support for security alerts

### Network Security
- ‚úÖ **Security headers**: X-Frame-Options, CSP, and other protective headers
- ‚úÖ **CORS protection**: Validates allowed origins for cross-origin requests

## Threat Model

MorphBox is designed for **LOCAL DEVELOPMENT USE ONLY**. When exposed to networks, it becomes a high-value target because it provides:

1. **Terminal Access**: Full shell access to the host system
2. **File System Access**: Read/write access to the mounted workspace
3. **Code Execution**: Ability to run arbitrary code
4. **AI Assistant**: Claude Code can be instructed to perform system operations

## Security Modes

### 1. Local Mode (DEFAULT - SAFE)
- **Binding**: localhost only
- **Access**: Only from the same machine
- **Authentication**: Not required
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Use Case**: Normal development

### 2. VPN Mode (RECOMMENDED for remote access)
- **Binding**: VPN interface only
- **Access**: Only VPN-connected devices
- **Authentication**: Optional (use --auth)
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Use Case**: Remote development on trusted networks

### 3. External Mode (DANGEROUS)
- **Binding**: All network interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- **Access**: Anyone on the network
- **Authentication**: MANDATORY (but not sufficient)
- **Risk Level**: EXTREME
- **Use Case**: Only in air-gapped, isolated environments

## Known Security Risks

### In External Mode:
1. **Remote Code Execution**: Attackers can run any command
2. **Data Exfiltration**: Source code and secrets can be stolen
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Terminal access may lead to root compromise
4. **Lateral Movement**: Your machine becomes an attack vector
5. **Resource Hijacking**: CPU/GPU can be used for cryptomining

### Remaining Security Considerations:
1. **Container Privileges**: Commands still run with user privileges inside container
2. **No TLS/HTTPS**: WebSocket and HTTP traffic not encrypted (planned for future)
3. **Token Expiration**: Sessions don't expire automatically (7-day default too long)
4. **2FA Not Available**: No two-factor authentication support yet

## Security Configuration Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Before running MorphBox, you MUST configure the following security settings:

```bash
# Copy the example security configuration
cp .env.security.example .env

# Edit .env and set strong passwords:
# - MORPHBOX_VM_PASSWORD (for SSH access)
# - MORPHBOX_AUTH_PASSWORD (for web authentication)
```

### Generate Strong Passwords

```bash
# Generate a secure SSH password
openssl rand -base64 16

# Generate a secure authentication token
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Docker Build with Security

When building the Docker container, pass the password as a build argument:

```bash
docker-compose build --build-arg MORPHBOX_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Never Use External Mode On:
- ‚ùå Public WiFi
- ‚ùå Corporate networks
- ‚ùå Production servers
- ‚ùå Machines with sensitive data
- ‚ùå Machines with production credentials

### 2. Always:
- ‚úÖ Use local mode when possible
- ‚úÖ Use VPN mode for remote access
- ‚úÖ Keep MorphBox updated
- ‚úÖ Review logs regularly
- ‚úÖ Use strong, unique passwords
- ‚úÖ Enable firewall rules

### 3. If You Must Use External Mode:
1. **Isolate the Network**: Use VLANs or air-gapped networks
2. **Restrict IPs**: Firewall rules to allow only specific IPs
3. **Monitor Access**: Log and alert on all connections
4. **Time Box**: Only enable when actively needed
5. **Assume Compromise**: Treat the machine as potentially compromised

## Incident Response

### If you suspect unauthorized access:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Stop MorphBox
   pkill -f morphbox
   
   # Block ports
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8008 -j DROP
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8009 -j DROP
   ```

2. **Investigation**:
   ```bash
   # Check connections
   netstat -an | grep -E "8008|8009"
   
   # Review process list
   ps aux | grep -E "node|npm|claude"
   
   # Check recent file changes
   find ~ -mtime -1 -type f
   
   # Review command history
   history | tail -100
   ```

3. **Containment**:
   - Disconnect from network
   - Preserve logs for analysis
   - Check for persistence mechanisms
   - Review user accounts and SSH keys

4. **Recovery**:
   - Consider full system reinstall if sensitive data was present
   - Rotate all credentials
   - Implement additional monitoring

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. **DO** email security reports to: security@morphbox.dev
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

## Security Hardening Checklist

- [ ] Using local mode (not --external)
- [ ] If remote access needed, using VPN mode
- [ ] Strong passwords set (if auth enabled)
- [ ] Firewall configured
- [ ] Monitoring enabled
- [ ] Regular updates applied
- [ ] Backup strategy in place
- [ ] Incident response plan ready

## Authentication Details

When authentication is enabled:
- Username and password are required for all access
- Credentials are shown when starting MorphBox
- Sessions expire after 7 days
- No password recovery mechanism (by design)

## Future Security Enhancements

Planned improvements for upcoming releases:

### v1.0 (High Priority)
1. **TLS/HTTPS Support**: Encrypted WebSocket and HTTP communications
2. **JWT Token Management**: Proper session expiration and refresh tokens
3. **2FA Support**: Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
4. **IP Allowlisting**: Restrict access to specific IP addresses

### v1.1 (Medium Priority)
5. **Encrypted Storage**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest
6. **Sandboxed Execution**: Additional isolation for command execution
7. **Read-only Mode**: Safe viewing mode without write access
8. **Advanced Audit Trail**: Detailed command history and file change tracking

### Completed (v0.9.3)
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting (implemented)
- ‚úÖ Basic audit logging (implemented)
- ‚úÖ Security headers (implemented)
- ‚úÖ Input sanitization (implemented)

Remember: **Security is your responsibility**. MorphBox provides tools, but proper configuration and usage are critical for maintaining security.

**When in doubt, don't expose MorphBox to the network.**
