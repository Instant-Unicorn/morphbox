# MorphBox Changelog

## 2025-01-06

### DEFINITIVE Fix for Workspace Directory Mounting

**Root Cause Identified & Fixed**:
- The Node.js wrapper was changing the working directory to morphbox installation directory before spawning the bash script
- This caused all subsequent `pwd` calls to return the morphbox directory instead of the user's directory

**The Solution**:
- Removed the `cwd: morphboxHome` option from the spawn call in `bin/morphbox.js`
- Now the bash script runs in the user's current directory, preserving the correct workspace mount

**Previous Attempts (that were incomplete)**:
- Added `INITIAL_PWD` capture (good, but was capturing after cwd change)
- Set `MORPHBOX_USER_DIR` environment variable (good, but wasn't the only issue)
- Fixed prepare-package script (necessary for deployment)

**Files Modified**:
- `web/bin/morphbox.js` - Removed cwd option that was changing directory
- `web/scripts/morphbox-start-packaged` - Uses INITIAL_PWD and MORPHBOX_USER_DIR
- `web/prepare-package.sh` - Ensures correct package installation

### Automatic Version Increment on Git Merge

**New Feature**:
- Added automatic version increment (0.0.1) after every git merge
- Implemented as a git post-merge hook for reliability
- Automatically updates package.json and package-lock.json
- Automatically updates CHANGELOG.md with version bump entry
- Creates a commit with the version change after merge

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `scripts/setup-version-bump-hook.sh` to install the git hook
- Git hook runs automatically after successful merges
- Version increments the patch number (e.g., 0.8.2 â†’ 0.8.3)
- Hook can be disabled by deleting `.git/hooks/post-merge`

**Usage**:
- Run `./scripts/setup-version-bump-hook.sh` to enable (already done)
- The hook will trigger automatically on `git merge` and `git pull`
- To disable: `rm .git/hooks/post-merge`

### Port Fallback Functionality

**New Feature**:
- Added automatic port fallback when default ports (8008 and 8009) are in use
- Web server will automatically find the next available port if 8008 is occupied
- WebSocket server will automatically find the next available port if 8009 is occupied
- Console output clearly indicates when fallback ports are being used
- Prevents application crashes due to "EADDRINUSE" errors

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `port-utils.ts` with utilities for checking port availability
- Updated `server.js` to use async port allocation with fallback
- Updated `websocket-server.ts` to check for available ports before binding
- Vite dev server already has built-in fallback, enabled with `strictPort: false`

**Files Modified**:
- `web/src/lib/server/port-utils.ts` - New utility functions
- `web/server.js` - Updated to use port fallback
- `web/src/lib/server/websocket-server.ts` - Updated to use port fallback
- `web/vite.config.ts` - Enabled Vite's built-in port fallback

### Added .morph File Format for Custom Panels

**New Features**:
- **Portable Panel Format**: Single `.morph` file contains code, metadata, and prompt history
- **Export Functionality**: Export any custom panel as a `.morph` file for sharing
- **Import Functionality**: Import `.morph` files from the community
- **Version Tracking**: Automatic version incrementing when panels are modified
- **Backward Compatibility**: Continues to support legacy `.js` and `.json` panel formats

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `MorphFileFormat` TypeScript interface for type safety
- Updated all API endpoints to handle both `.morph` and legacy formats
- Added export button to each custom panel in the Panel Manager
- Added import button to the Custom Panels header
- Handles ID conflicts during import by auto-generating unique IDs

**Files Added**:
- `web/src/lib/types/morph.ts` - Type definitions
- `web/src/routes/api/custom-panels/code/[id]/+server.ts` - Code loading endpoint
- `web/src/routes/api/custom-panels/export/[id]/+server.ts` - Export endpoint
- `web/src/routes/api/custom-panels/import/+server.ts` - Import endpoint

**Files Modified**:
- Updated all custom panel API endpoints for .morph support
- Enhanced PanelManager UI with import/export buttons
- Modified CustomPanelRenderer to load from new endpoints

### Fixed Custom Panel Execution Issues

**Problems Solved**:
1. **Panels Not Executing**: Custom panels were showing blank with only "view source" button
2. **JavaScript Syntax Errors**: "Unexpected token '&'" due to HTML entity encoding
3. **Claude CLI Timeouts**: Panel generation failing after 30-60 seconds
4. **Fallback Content**: Panels showing placeholder content instead of using Claude

**Solutions**:
1. **Script Execution**: Switched from blob URLs to srcdoc for proper script execution in iframes
2. **Entity Encoding**: Fixed by escaping `</script>` tags in template literals
3. **Directory Isolation**: Create dedicated temp directory for each Claude invocation
4. **No Fallback Policy**: Panels now require Claude or fail with proper error

**Result**: Custom panels now execute their code properly and Claude integration works reliably.

### Fixed Terminal Loading Issues

**Problem**: Terminal was stuck at "MorphBox Terminal v2.0.0 Launching Claude..." and Claude wouldn't display properly.

**Root Causes**:
1. Component lifecycle issues - Terminal components were being destroyed and recreated when layout loaded from server
2. MutationObserver error during component destruction due to null reference
3. WebSocket connections closing prematurely 
4. Multiple simultaneous WebSocket connections being created
5. Event listeners not being properly cleaned up

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Fixed Component Recreation**: Modified `loadLayoutFromServer()` in RowLayout.svelte to update existing panels instead of clearing and recreating them
2. **Fixed MutationObserver Error**: Added null checks for `terminalContainer?.getBoundingClientRect()` 
3. **Fixed Event Listener Cleanup**: Stored references to event handlers for proper removal during cleanup
4. **Fixed WebSocket Duplicates**: Added guard to prevent multiple simultaneous WebSocket connections
5. **Fixed Persistent SSH Agent**: Changed docker exec from `-it` to `-t` flag
6. **Fixed Prop Warnings**: Added missing props to Claude and Terminal components
7. **Added Accessibility**: Added id/name attributes to xterm helper textarea

**Files Modified**:
- web/src/lib/Terminal.svelte
- web/src/lib/RowLayout.svelte  
- web/src/lib/Claude.svelte
- web/src/lib/server/persistent-session-manager.ts
- web/src/lib/server/websocket.ts
- web/src/lib/server/agents/persistent-ssh-agent.ts

**Result**: Claude now loads and displays properly in the terminal without component lifecycle issues or WebSocket disconnections.
